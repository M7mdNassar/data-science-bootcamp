### 4. Department-wise Attendance Analysis
- Created a pivot table to calculate average attendance per department
- Identified the department with the highest attendance rate
- Visualized results using a column chart

---

### 5. Age Range vs Graduation Year Analysis
- Grouped students into age ranges
- Analyzed student distribution across graduation years
- Used pivot tables to identify patterns and trends

---

### 6. Gender-based Analysis per Department
- Analyzed gender distribution across departments
- Used pivot tables with counts and percentages
